","body":"# SpryAudio\r\n\r\n* SpryAudio is a Java audio/sound library with an easy to use API for quick \r\n  playback of WAV, AIFF, AU, MP3, Ogg, and AAC audio files. \r\n* Functionality includes volume control, pause/resume, looping, \r\n  position-setting of audio, and querying of playback state.   \r\n* Audio playback can be either preloaded or streamed. In a nutshell, the\r\n  preloaded approach offers the lowest latency and the most functionality,\r\n  while streaming uses the least amount of memory. See the \r\n  [Javadoc](http://cmholton.github.io/SpryAudio/doc) (the PreloadedAudio and \r\n  StreamingAudio classes) for more detailed information. \r\n* SpryAudio is built on top of Java Sound and utilizes the Tritonus, JLayer,\r\n  JOrbis, and JAAD libraries through Java's SPI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to Setup\r\n\r\n* When using SpryAudio as a library, the following must be on the classpath: \r\n    * SpryAudio jar (spryaudio-1.x.x.jar found in the dist directory of this \r\n      repo)\r\n    * The media files that you want to play\r\n    * The third-party audio libraries (those found in the lib-mp3-ogg and \r\n      lib-aac directories of this repo). \r\n* NOTE: Not all of the libraries are necessary, depending on the specific\r\n  type(s) of audio formats you plan on playing. See the README-LIBS file in \r\n  this repo's lib-mp3-ogg directory for specific information.\r\n* NOTE: The JAAD library (located in the lib-aac directory) must be on the end\r\n  of the classpath in order to play AAC files. See the *Known Issues* section\r\n  below for more information.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n### How to Use\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Initialize the SpryAudio system.\r\nSpryAudio.init();\r\n\r\n// Create the audio and begin playback.\r\nStreamingAudio music = SpryAudio.createStreamingAudio(\"theme_song.mp3\");\r\nStreamingPlayback musicPlayback = music.play();\r\n\r\n// When ready, stop the audio.\r\nmusicPlayback.stop();\r\n\t\t\r\n// Shutdown the SpryAudio system.\r\nSpryAudio.shutdown();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to Run the Demo\r\n\r\n* A demo is included with the source code. To run the demo, execute the \r\n  \"run-demo\" default target in the Ant build file. The build file automatically \r\n  adds the third-party libs and media to the classpath.\r\n* NOTE: Running the demo via Ant causes higher overall CPU usage vs. running\r\n  the demo without Ant.\r\n  \r\n\r\n### Repository Organization\r\n\r\n* src directory - spryaudio package - The SpryAudio API that client code uses\r\n* src directory - spryaudio.util.logging package - Logging configuration code\r\n* src directroy - demo package - Contains a runnable demo\r\n* dist directory - Contains the SpryAudio jar\r\n* lib-mp3-ogg directory - Contains third-party libs needed for playback of MP3\r\n  and Ogg audio\r\n* lib-aac directory - Contains the third-party lib needed for playback of AAC\r\n  audio. In its own directory, the lib can be easily added to the end of the\r\n  classpath.\r\n* media directory - Contains some sample audio files used in the demo\r\n* doc directory - Contains the SpryAudio Javadoc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n* [SpryAudio Javadoc](http://cmholton.github.io/SpryAudio/doc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n* [LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\nThere are no known issues with the SpryAudio code. However, there are two\r\nissues that have been encountered when using the JAAD library with SpryAudio: \r\n\r\n* JAAD library issue #1 - JAAD does not seem to like all AAC files, at \r\n  least when it is used as a Java Sound SPI as it is here with SpryAudio. \r\n  Specifically, after testing with a large sample of AAC files (100 files),\r\n  roughly 60% were able to \tbe played, and the rest caused an error with \r\n  JAAD. The exception was m4a files downloaded from iTunes, all of which \r\n  (25 files tested) played without any problem. \r\n* JAAD library issue #2 - When used in conjunction with other Java Sound \r\n  SPI libraries, JAAD will attempt to decode all audio formats, even when the\r\n  input file is an audio format other than AAC, thus preventing the \r\n  appropriate library from being used. To work around this, a slightly \r\n  modified version of the JAAD library (located in the lib-aac directory) is \r\n  used instead. Additionally, the modified JAAD library needs to be on the\r\n  end of the classpath. If it is not on the end of the classpath, AAC files\r\n  will fail to be decoded, however files of other formats should still be \r\n  properly handled.     \r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\n* Christian Holton <cmholton@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
