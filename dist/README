===== SpryAudio =====

* SpryAudio is a Java audio/sound library with an easy to use API for quick 
  playback of WAV, AIFF, AU, MP3, Ogg, and AAC audio files. 
* Functionality includes volume control, pause/resume, looping, 
  position-setting of audio, and querying of playback state.   
* Audio playback can be either preloaded or streamed. In a nutshell, the
  preloaded approach offers the lowest latency and the most functionality,
  while streaming uses the least amount of memory. See the 
  [Javadoc](http://cmholton.github.io/SpryAudio/doc) (the PreloadedAudio and 
  StreamingAudio classes) for more detailed information. 
* SpryAudio is built on top of Java Sound and utilizes the Tritonus, JLayer,
  JOrbis, and JAAD libraries through Java's SPI.
